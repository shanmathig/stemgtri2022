# Directed Graph Implementation
Object representations for nodes and edges on a directed graph. Inputs and outputs are currently represented as nodes, as are logic gates.

## Sample Files
* main.py constructs a directed graph representation for the AND3 yosys sample found in the example_circuits directory. You can find a visual representation in the AND3.gv file. This [website](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/) can be used to visualize the graph. Just paste AND3.gv inside the editor on the website.
* test.py is for testing class methods.

## Running Files
Use ```python main.py``` or ```python test.py``` to run the desired file.
