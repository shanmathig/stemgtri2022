# Flask

Flask is a Python framework for creating server-side applications.

# p5.js

p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else. You can think of your whole browser page as your sketch, including HTML5 objects for text, input, video, webcam, and sound.

## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Flask (you will already have to have Python 3+). This used Python 3.7.2, but as long as it is Python 3+, the program should work.

```bash
pip install Flask
```
You don't need to install p5.js because it is already downloaded and routed in the html.

## Usage
To start the server from the root directory, simply paste the command below to start it.
```bash
python -m server.app
``` 

To edit any of the visuals through p5, go to `static/js/index.js` and edit as so. A full documentation and tutorials can be found on the p5.js [website](https://p5js.org/).
